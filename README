Graphical structogram editor aimed at students

Current state:
 * Class structure of statements and constructs implemented
 * General text output with basic syntax descriptor files

Future milestones:
 * Simple Swing interface with text view based on above mentioned syntaxes
   and complete support for editing, saving, loading algorithms and syntaxes
 * Evaluate and use one of the following to create a zoomable structogram view:
   - piccolo2d: http://www.piccolo2d.org/index.html
   - ZVTM: http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/
   - SpaceGraphJ: http://automenta.com/spacegraph
 * Experiments with alternative controls for the structogram view.
   Example: "add box below" button on the box itself
